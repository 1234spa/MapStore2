# Exploring Stories
**********************

In [MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/), the Story is a tool that allows you to express in a simple and dynamic way a concept, combining and connecting text, maps, images, video and other media as desired. The final result is an interactive flux of information that reflects user customizations.

The user can approach with a story in two different ways:

* Creating a new story or editing an existing one through the *Edit Mode*
* Enjoy the story and interact with it, through the *View Mode*

## Edit Mode

The *Edit Mode* is an approach that allows the user to edit a story by adding, removing or modifying the elements inside it. This operating mode and its tools are used both to edit an existing story and to create a new one. In order to create a new story, the user can click on the **New Story** button <img src="../img/button/new-story.jpg" style="max-width:30px" valign="middle"/> on [MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) homepage. As soon as you perform this operation the workflow appears in *Edit Mode* and composed of two main elements: the *Builder* and the *Sections Container* (later simply called *Container*).

The information flux of the Story is organized in Sections, that can be added from the <img src="../img/button/add-section.jpg" style="max-width:30px" valign="middle"/> button on the bottom of the *Container*. In particular, the user can take advantage of four different types of sections:

* [Title Section](title-section.md)
* [Paragraph Section](paragraph-section.md)
* [Immersive Section](immersive-section.md)
* [Media Section](media-section.md)
