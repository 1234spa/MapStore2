# Exploring Stories
**********************

In [MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/), the Story is a tool that allows the user to express in a simple and dynamic way a concept combining and connecting text, maps, images, videos and other media as desired. The final result is an interactive flux of information customized according to user defined styles.

It is possible to approach a story in two different ways:

* Creating a new story or editing an existing one through the *Edit Mode*
* Present or simply enjoy a story and interact with it, through the *View Mode*

## Edit Mode

The *Edit Mode* allows the user to edit a story by adding, removing or modifying the elements inside it. This approach and its tools are used both to customize an existing story and to create a new one. <br>
In order to create a new story, the user can click on the **New Story** button <img src="../img/button/new-story.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> on [MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) homepage. As soon as you perform this operation appears the workflow in *Edit Mode*, composed of two main elements: the *Builder* and the *Sections Container* (later simply called *Container*).

The information flux of the Story is organized in Sections, that can be added from the <img src="../img/button/add-section.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> button on the bottom of the *Container*. In particular, the user can take advantage of four different types of sections:

* [Title Section](title-section.md)
* [Paragraph Section](paragraph-section.md)
* [Immersive Section](immersive-section.md)
* [Media Section](media-section.md)

## View Mode

The *View Mode* is a useful way of approaching a story when you would like to present the content of your work to someone, or simply every time you need to check up the progress of your project. <br>
The user can access the *View Mode* through the **Show preview** button <img src="../img/button/show-preview.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> in Builder's toolbar, and the first display is organized like the following:

<img src="../img/exploring-stories/view-mode.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

Most of the page is occupied by a large space that show the story, navigable also through the Navigation bar on the top-right:

The user, scrolling through the story, can interact with it browsing and zooming the maps, or observing fullscreen images and videos with just one click on them.

In order to switch back to *Edit Mode*, there is the **Edit story** button <img src="../img/button/edit-icon-1.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> on the top-left.

## Save a Story

Both in *Edit Mode* and *View Mode*, the user can save his story through the **Options** button <img src="../img/button/burger.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> on the top bar. If the story is not saved yet, there's only the possibility to perform the *Save*, but if a story has already benn saved it is possible to choose between:

* *Save*, when you want to see or change the properties with which the story was last saved

* *Save as*, when you want to create a new story and you want to set the properties from scratch

In order to Save a story for the first time, the following window opens:

<img src="../img/exploring-stories/save-story.jpg" class="ms-docimage" width="400px"/>

In here the user can set the following properties:

* **Thumbnail**

* **Name** (the only mandatory field)

* **Description**

* **Permissions**
